# GitHub Repository Analyzer

A minimalist, elegant web application that analyzes any public GitHub repository and provides detailed insights about its activity, structure, and health.

Users simply paste a GitHub repository URL and instantly receive a structured and animated analysis report.

The platform is designed to be **fast, free, simple, and developer-friendly**.

---

# Product Vision

Developers, recruiters, and open-source contributors often need to quickly evaluate a GitHub repository.

Important questions include:

- Is the project active?
- How many people contribute to it?
- What technologies are used?
- Is the repository well maintained?

GitHub Repository Analyzer transforms raw GitHub data into **clear insights, visual metrics, and a health score**.

The goal is to build a **minimalist but powerful developer tool**.

---

# Core Features

## Repository Analysis

User inputs a repository URL.

Example:

```
<https://github.com/facebook/react>
```

The system fetches repository data and generates a structured analysis.

---

# Analysis Data

The analyzer should provide multiple layers of insights.

---

# 1. Repository Overview

Basic repository metadata:

- Repository name
- Owner
- Description
- Creation date
- Last updated date
- Default branch
- License type
- Repository size
- Number of files (estimated)
- Repository visibility

Example output:

```
Repository: react
Owner: facebook
Created: 2013
Last Updated: recently
License: MIT
Size: 180 MB
```

---

# 2. Activity Metrics

Repository activity analysis:

- Total commits
- Commits in last 30 days
- Commits in last 90 days
- Average commits per month
- Last commit date
- Commit activity trend

Example metrics:

```
Total commits: 12450
Last 30 days: 85
Average per month: 120
Last commit: 2 days ago
```

Visualization:

- commit frequency chart
- activity timeline

---

# 3. Contributors Analysis

Contributor insights:

- Total contributors
- Top contributors
- Contribution percentages
- Contributor activity ranking

Example:

```
Contributors: 145
Top contributor: 24% of commits
```

Bus Factor estimate:

Bus Factor represents the number of contributors responsible for most of the work.

Example:

```
Bus Factor: 3
```

Meaning: if three key developers leave, the project could be at risk.

---

# 4. Language Distribution

The analyzer retrieves language statistics.

Example:

```
JavaScript: 65%
TypeScript: 20%
CSS: 10%
HTML: 5%
```

Visualization:

- donut chart
- animated language bars

---

# 5. Repository Popularity

Popularity indicators:

- Stars
- Forks
- Watchers
- Open issues
- Closed issues
- Pull requests

Example:

```
Stars: 210k
Forks: 43k
Watchers: 6k
Open Issues: 900
Closed Issues: 12k
```

---

# 6. Issue & Maintenance Health

Repository maintenance indicators:

- open vs closed issues
- average issue resolution time
- pull request merge rate
- pull request approval time
- issue response speed

Example:

```
Issue resolution time: 4.2 days
PR merge rate: 92%
```

---

# 7. Codebase Insights

Structural insights about the repository:

- estimated lines of code
- total files
- folder depth
- largest directories
- largest files

Example:

```
Files: 2,450
Directories: 120
Largest folder: src
Estimated LOC: 380,000
```

---

# 8. Repository Health Score

The system calculates a **health score from 0 to 100**.

Factors include:

- activity frequency
- contributor diversity
- issue management
- documentation presence
- update frequency
- community engagement

Example:

```
Health Score: 82 / 100
Status: Healthy Project
```

Score meaning:

```
90 - 100  Excellent
75 - 89   Healthy
50 - 74   Moderate
30 - 49   Risky
0 - 29    Inactive
```

Analyze any GitHub repository instantly

[ Paste GitHub repository URL ]

[ Analyze Repository ]
```

---

# Analysis Flow

When the user clicks analyze:

Loading animation appears.

Example loading steps:

```
Fetching repository data...
Analyzing commits...
Calculating repository health...
Generating insights...
```

After loading, results appear **section by section with animation**.

---

# Animations

Animations should feel smooth and modern.

Examples:

- fade in
- slide up
- number counters
- chart animations

Example:

```
Commits counter: 0 → 1250
Stars counter: 0 → 5600
```

Libraries that can help:

- Framer Motion
- Chart.js
- Recharts
- D3.js
