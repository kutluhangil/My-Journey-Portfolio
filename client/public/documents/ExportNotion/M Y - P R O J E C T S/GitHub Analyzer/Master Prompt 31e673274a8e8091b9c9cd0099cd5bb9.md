MAIN USER FLOW

1. User opens the website.
2. User pastes a GitHub repository URL.
3. User clicks "Analyze Repository".
4. A loading animation appears showing progress steps.
5. The system fetches repository data using GitHub APIs.
6. The results appear gradually with smooth animations.
7. The user can export the report as a PDF.
8. The user can optionally send the report to their email.
